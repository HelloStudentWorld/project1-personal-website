# Planning Phase
The following requirements are related to how you go about building your project
Planning phase - planning should be completed prior to beginning the development phase and/or touching any code.

# User Stories
1) Write out at least three user stories that describe how a user will interact with your site

- User Story #1: As a potential employer, I want to easily navigate through the portfolio so I can quickly assess the candidate's skills and projects.
- User Story #2: As a visitor, I want to see detailed information about each project with images and descriptions so I can understand the scope of work and technologies used.
- User Story #3: As a recruiter, I want a quick way to contact the candidate via a contact form or email link so I can arrange interviews or ask for further details.

# Wireframes
2) Go ahead and create wireframes of each page of your site--they should include important content and user interface elements such as images, links, buttons etc.
Wireframes can be done on paper or using any number of widely available applications. A free one that may be useful is draw.io.
